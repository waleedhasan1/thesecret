        <p>There is an apocalyptic edge to some of the Quranic, especially the Meccan, revelations when they expound that the end is near:
            “They see the (day) far off, but We (God) see it quite near,” (70:6 to 7, Early Meccan). “The hour of judgment is near, and the moon
            is split,” (54:1, Middle Meccan). “Verily the hour is coming. My (Gods) design is to keep it hidden,so that every soul be rewarded by the
            measure of its endeavor,” (20:15, Middle Meccan). “Closer and closer to people is their reckoning, while they in neglect turn away,” (21:1,
            Middle Meccan).
            But [even] according to the (chronologically) earliest revelation regarding the hour, its appointed time is known only to God, and
            the Prophet is but a warner for those who fear it (79:42 to 46,Early Meccan). This theme is reiterated in two late Meccan revelations:
            “Verily the knowledge of the hour is with God alone. He sends down rain, and He knows what is in the wombs,” (31:34, Late
            Meccan), and “The knowledge (of the hour) is with my Lord, none but He (can) reveal its time,” (7:187, Late Meccan), and also in a
            Medinan revelation:
            “Men ask you about the hour. Say: knowledge of it is with God. What will make you understand? Perhaps the hour is near,” (33:63,
            Medinan).
            On the other hand, the Quran gives only the sparsest detail on any portents that would indicate the hours imminent arrival.
            Among the signs of the hour is the observable disintegration of established familial, societal, and economic norms.4 Then, “When the
            word is fulfilled against them (the sinners), We shall produce for them from the earth a beast to speak to them, because people did not
            believe with assurance in Our signs,” (27:82, Middle Meccan); the nations of Gog and Magog will break through their ancient barrier
            wall and sweep down to scourge the earth (21:96 to 97, Middle Meccan); and Jesus is “a sign of the hour”(43:61, Middle Meccan).
            By contrast, the Quranic revelations provide an abundance of eschatological detail that begins with Gods cosmic undoing of the
            “old world” followed by the last judgment and creation of a “new world” of everlasting paradise and hell. Thus, while the “terrestrial
            signs of the hour” remain a relatively marginal theme in the Quranic message, the actual occurrence of doom (destruction of the cosmos and cosmic time), resurrection, last judgment, and individual assignment to an eternal abode of beatitude or torment are a fully
            developed part of Quranic doctrine.</p>
            <p>Unlike the Qur’an,it is the Hadith that furnishes a vast variety of detail on the portents of the hour that signify its imminence. In many
                cases, these resemble the “signs” of Judeo-Christian apocalyptic literature.Western scholarship both old and new has attributed this fact
                to the prominence of Jewish and Christian converts to Islam who played important roles as scripturalist experts (Qur’an interpreters
                and, especially, transmitters of Hadith) during the first century-and-a-half of Islamic history.5 In addition, Western scholars have read
                the apocalyptic Hadith as a reflection of the cultural,social, and political turmoil that marked Muslim history during the same period.6
                Muslim theologians and historians would refer to these times of turmoil in early Islamic history as fitna [“secession, upheaval,
                seduction,anarchy”]. It was also by the concept of fitna,in its plural fitan,that the compilers of Hadith collections inscribed their chapters on the turmoils that signal the end of the world. Over time, a small portion of the apocalyptic Hadith gained canonical status (in
                Sunni Islam) by way of its inclusion in the legal foundational texts and, especially, the canonical Hadith collections (The Six Books of
                “Sound Traditions”) that have held prominence in Sunni doctrine and law since their first appearance during early Abbasid times. The
                six Hadith compilations in question were the work of al-Bukhari (d. 870), Muslim ibn Hajjaj (d. 875), Abu Da’ud (d. 888), al-Tirmidhi
                (d.892),al-Nasa’i (d. 915),and Ibn Maja (d.886). From among the founders of the four extant schools of jurisprudence, the “legal textbooks” of Malik ibn Anas (d. 795) and Ahmad ibn Hanbal (d. 855),likewise written in the form of Hadith collections, form part of this
                recorded corpus of “sound” traditions as measured by classical Islamic criteria of authentication (regarding source and chain of transmission).
                These canonical sources’ emphasis lay on careful definition and elaboration of the Islamic legal tradition, while apocalyptic matters (including traditions of a messianic nature) were of secondary or tertiary interest. The books on fitan generally appear at (or
                towards) the end of these classical Hadith collections.7 At an early age,rationalist Muslim critics professed profound reservations about
                the validity of (at least parts of) those apocalyptic Hadith materials, even though they had been assembled in the canonical books. A
                fourteenth-century example of this critical trend is the celebrated historian and legal authority Ibn Khaldun (d. 1406) who inter alia,
                when writing about the figure of the Mahdi, questioned the interplay between apocalyptic tradition, esoteric interpretation of Sura 18
                (“The Cave”) and historical political claims,especially of the Twelver-Shi’a,in a manner that betrayed his personal mistrust of the validity of apocalyptic texts.8 Nineteenth- and twentieth-century Sunni modernist thought has more systematically questioned the authenticity of this apocalyptic Hadith, referring to it by the older label of isra’iliyyat (“Bible-derived traditions”), that hold at best some symbolic significance. Such language from the likes of the Egyptian modernist theologian Muhammad Abduh (d.1905) or his Syrian disciple Rashid Rida (d.1935) 9 can induce apoplectic rage in the more literalist,traditionalist contemporary compilers of the classical Hadith,
                for whom every detail of the transmitted texts is true.10
                The sheer volume of available, canonical and sectarian, classical and later Hadith on apocalyptic themes has for many centuries
                enabled Islamic scholars to forge their own collections of these materials. By nature of the subject, such textual activities always had a
                potential political edge. As is more fully discussed in what follows, the manner in which Islamic scholars have historically handled
                Hadith end time predictions has been indicative not just of their religious orientation but also their stance toward the political system
                under which they performed their work. Lately that stance has been affected by ideological concerns regarding world politics in the
                manner and language of Samuel Huntington’s “clash of civilizations.” While, on the whole, Huntington’s oeuvre so far has a hear-say
                presence in the contemporary Islamic and Islamist discourses, an echo of his language is discernible in new formulations of pre-existing anti-colonialist patterns of thought and argumentation.11
                The apocalyptic Hadith has been classified in several ways. Some sources distinguish the “minor signs” of the hour from its “major
                signs.” Others distinguish between “signs that have passed,” “signs that can be observed at present,” and “signs that have not yet
                occurred.” Here the “signs that have passed” are historical events which were, or are, recorded in the nature of historical “markers” on
                the way of mankind’s linear approach to its final destination. The second category, “signs that can be observed at present,” functions to
                denounce religious aberrations, including innovative and other objectionable cultural, social, and political practices, in “mirror of the
                times fashion;”their import,then, is largely moral guidance in that they promote a reversed (upside-down) vision of godly society. The
                third category, “signs that have not yet occurred,” contains the metahistorical and messianic traditions on the (Qur’anic) “beast from
                the earth,” a (non-Qur’anic) antichrist figure (Dajjal), the devastation of the earth by Gog and Magog (Qur’anic), the return of Jesus
                (Qur’anic),and also the return of a second messianic figure called the Mahdi (“the rightly guided one”) (not mentioned in the Qur’an).
                The lines between these three categories are, however, fluid. This fact essentially derives from the paradigmatic nature of the apocalyptic Hadith. While later Hadith criticism (including of the modern rationalist and reformist schools of Islam) would argue that historical events were often cast as “minor signs” in the form of prophetic Hadith, to their more literalist adherents these traditions were not
                only literally true, but their prophesizing nature also left room that these events could re-occur, at much later times and under vastly
                different conditions than when they first appeared to be fulfilled.
